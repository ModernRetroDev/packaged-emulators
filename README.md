# Packaged Emulators
This repostiory exists to capture compiled and packaged emulators which would otherwise be very difficult to distribute in working form.

As much as possible, I'd like to just grab and use releases of codes, however, if those don't work for some reason, I will try to compile and package them myself here.

I will do my best to point towards the original repository where the code came from and describe the build process used to create the resulting binaries.
